TODO
   GLOBAL
    - further parse the case info to get department, building, etc
    - add function to check if the running_total matches the highest case # of the latest day. this will
      tell us if we missed any cases.
    - add function to check if the total number of cases distributed to each location matches the highest case #
      (less 87 to account for the website starting at case #88)

   POSTGRES
    - remove the BIGSERIAL column and make case_num the primary key
    - check if a record is already in the database before adding



DONE
 - some days are not delineated by the <pre> html tag, but rather by the <p> html tag--need to handle this
 - modularize code into functions
 -
