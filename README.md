## **COVID Scraper**
#### Overview
This project retrieves data from the Electric Boat [EBLanding](https://eblanding.com/covid-19-case-report-summary/) COVID-19 Case Report Summary website and plots it in interesting ways.
#### Methods
`main.py` is the driver that calls all functions.
`get_web_data.py` uses the `requests` and `beautifulsoup` libraries to make the http request to the URL and parse the html.
